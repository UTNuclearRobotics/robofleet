# Robofleet

This project aims to create a system that enables [ROS][ros]-based robot-to-robot communication, as well as visualization of robot data via a web-based frontend. Robots will run a client application to exchange data with a central server.

Each physical robot has existing control software, which publishes messages to the robotâ€™s [ROS topics][ros topics]. The Robofleet client will exchange these existing messages with the Robofleet server. Using Robofleet, this software may also subscribe to ROS topics for information from other robots or control messages.

This project targets the ROS 1 framework.

## Usage

You will need to set up different components of Robofleet depending on your use case.

### Add a robot

`robofleet_client` enables a robot to exchange ROS messages with `robofleet_server`. To set up a new robot with Robofleet:
1. Clone `robofleet_client` and follow the build instructions in its `README` file
2. Choose a [ROS Namespace][namespaces] for the robot.
3. Extend an existing ROS node to publish `amrl_msgs/RobofleetStatus` messages to the `status` topic. This will list your robot in the web visualizer, though it is not strictly necessary.
    * Alternatively, use `robofleet_client/scripts/basic_status.py` to quickly list your robot.
4. Run your existing ROS nodes within the namespace--see [ROS Name Remapping][remapping]. The simplest method is to set the `ROS_NAMESPACE` environment variable.
    * Ensure that your ROS nodes are using [relative names][relative names] and not absolute names internally.
5. Run the `robofleet_client` in the same namespace (e.g. `ROS_NAMESPACE="/x/y/z" make run`)
6. Grant your robot permissions in the config file for `robofleet_server`

* **Unstable:** currently, `robofleet_client` receives all ROS messages of any given type. You can configure which message types it handles and which topics it transmits in its configuration file.
* **Unstable:** currently, `robofleet_server` simply broadcasts each message to all authorized clients. In the future, it will be possible to subscribe to messages on particular topics from other clients, rather than receiving on all topics.

### Run the server

`robofleet_server` enables broadcasting of ROS messages between many clients (robots and visualizers) over the network. To run the server:
1. Clone `robofleet_server` and follow the build instructions in its `README` file
2. Start the server with `yarn start`

### Use the web visualizer

`robofleet_webviz` is a browser-based Robofleet client that presents a GUI for many kinds of ROS messages received from `robofleet_server`. A special `RobofleetStatus` message enables a listing of all connected robots. To run the web visualizer:
1. Clone `robofleet_webviz` and follow the build instructions in its `README` file
2. Run the development server with `yarn start`

## Development

Most development tasks are isolated to each component of Robofleet. However, there are some tasks that require coordination across all components.

### Add a new message type (~30 mins)

**Unstable** This section is subject to change. See _Future changes_. 

To exchange ROS messages over the network, with support for message metadata and unusual kinds of clients (such as the browser), Robofleet needs a structured message encoding format. Robofleet currently encodes messages using [Flatbuffers][flatbuffers]. For details on how ROS messages are encoded in Flatbuffers, see the `README` for `msg2fbs`.

Imagine that you want to visualize some new message type, `my_viz/Marker`. First, build each of the Robofleet components as explained in each of their `README` files. Then, follow these steps:
1. `cd msg2fbs`
   1. Add `amrl_msgs` to `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`; after ensuring that it is built:
      `export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=../robofleet_client/amrl_msgs:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`
      1. If your new message type is also in a local (not installed) package, make sure that it is also in your path.
   2. Add the ROS name of the message type (e.g. `my_viz/Marker`) to the top of the `makefile`
   3. `make` to generate code and copy it into each Robofleet component.
2. `cd ../robofleet_client`
   1. Edit `src/config.hpp` to call `register_msg_type()` once per message type and topic, as shown in the example configuration. 
      For example: `register_msg_type<my_viz::Marker>("my/topic")`
      Remember to include the ROS headers for your new message type.
   2. Edit `encode.hpp` to specialize `encode<>()` for your new message type. See other implementations for examples. 
      * It helps to set up autocompletion in your editor.
      * Robofleet only uses the `metadata` attribute on the root message type. For example, if `my_viz/Marker` contains a `std_msgs/String`, you can set the `metadata` attribute of the `std_msgs/String` to null.
      * Make sure to call `fbb.Finish()`, passing in the result of creating the root message type, as seen in existing examples.
   3. Edit `decode.hpp` to specialize `decode<>()` for your new message type.
   4. `make` to test your changes
      * Linker errors generally indicate that you did not correctly specialize `encode<>()` or `decode<>()`.
   5. `make format` to clean up your code
   6. Commit the changes.
3. `cd ../robofleet_server`
   1. `yarn build` to test the new schema code.
   2. Commit the changes.
4. `cd ../robofleet_webviz`
   1. `yarn build` to test the new schema code.
   2. Commit the changes.
5. `cd ..`
   1. Add the updated submodule commits and the changes to `msg2fbs`.
   2. Commit the changes.

All done! Now, you can consume the new message type in `robofleet_webviz`, as well as transmit and receive it with the `robofleet_client`.

#### Future changes

When JavaScript support for [Flexbuffers][flexbuffers] is [added][flexbuffers js], it would be possible to switch from Flatbuffers to Flexbuffers encoding fairly seamlessly. This would:
* Eliminate the need to maintain a schema and generated code
* Move the burden of schema conformance into application code (no schemas means implicit schemas, defined by how message fields are accessed in code.)
* Allow the encoding of all message types automatically by the robot client*
    * handling dynamically-typed ROS messages in C++ is probably possible [using ShapeShifter][generic subscriber] and [ros_msg_parser][ros_msg_parser] (formerly ros_type_introspection)
    * `msg2fbs` demonstrates how to encode arbitrary message types using `rospy`
